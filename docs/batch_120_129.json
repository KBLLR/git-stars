He discusses the health benefits of stevia and the legal challenges he faces selling it due to labeling restrictions on medicinal plants. P\u00e0mies also criticizes pharmaceutical companies for profiting from chronic illnesses and calls for a \"sweet revolution\" to raise awareness about natural cures.",

    "description": "This document describes a method for modeling hand shapes using sets of landmark points. The process begins by obtaining a small number of landmark points on a hand image, which are then used to derive more points using algorithms. These points are then analyzed to generate intermediate points and finger midlines. Finally, the document discusses how to use Kroon's Active Shape Model (ASM) and Active Appearance Model (AAM) package to further process the landmark points.",
