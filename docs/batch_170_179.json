    "description": "The document presents a novel neural representation called Neural Head Avatars. This representation models the surface geometry and appearance of a human avatar, enabling its use in applications like teleconferencing in AR/VR. The representation is learned from monocular RGB portrait videos, capturing various expressions and views. The authors propose a hybrid representation combining a morphable model for coarse shape and expressions with feed-forward networks for predicting vertex offsets and view/expression-dependent textures. This approach allows for accurate extrapolation to unseen poses and viewpoints, generating natural expressions with sharp details. The authors demonstrate the superiority of their method over previous works through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, highlighting its ability to generate photorealistic results, handle large viewpoint changes, and provide disentangled shape and appearance modeling.",

    "description": "The document introduces HOVER, a novel neural controller designed for whole-body control of humanoid robots. HOVER distinguishes itself through its versatility, accommodating diverse control modes such as navigation, loco-manipulation, and tabletop manipulation. Unlike conventional approaches that train separate policies for each mode, HOVER utilizes a unified policy, enabling seamless transitions between modes while retaining the strengths of each. This is achieved through a policy distillation process from an \"oracle motion imitator\" trained on a large-scale human motion dataset. HOVER's performance surpasses individually trained policies and other multi-mode training methods, demonstrating its superior generalization and robustness in both simulations and real-world scenarios on a Unitree H1 robot.",

It allows control of JavaScript objects within a webpage and can also interact with remote applications via MIDI and OSC using a node.js script or the Interface.js Server application. The library prioritizes performance-oriented layouts and minimizes the need for CSS, requiring only basic HTML tags for a full-window interface. Interface.js offers a visual interface editor for designing layouts and depends on zepto.js, with jQuery as an alternative. When used with Interface. Server, Zepto is loaded automatically.",

    "description": "Storytelling for Virtual Reality serves as a bridge between students of new media and professionals working in the emerging world of VR technology and the art form of classical storytelling. Rather than examining purely the tech- nical, the text focuses on the narrative and how stories can best be structured, created, and then told in virtual immersive spaces. Author John Bucher examines the timeless principles of storytelling and how they are being applied, transformed, and transcended in Virtual Reality. Interviews, con- versations, and case studies with both pioneers and innovators in VR story- telling are featured, including industry leaders at LucasFilm, 20th Century Fox, Oculus, Insomniac Games, and Google.",
